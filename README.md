# Block-Shuffle
This is a datapack for the minigame Block Shuffle on Minecraft Java Edition.

To use the datapack, download the zip file for the latest release of whatever tag corresponds to the game version you want to play. 
After this, drag the folder within the .zip to your minecraft world's datapacks folder.

Type '/datapack enable "file/BlockSwap"' to enable to pack.
Type '/function blockswap:disable' to delete the pack and all of its attributes from the world. 

Everything else should be self-explanatory.

If you have any questions, or need to contact me, you can find my discord in the credits within the pack, or at AntherXx#5392
